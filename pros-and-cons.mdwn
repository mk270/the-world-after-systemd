## Pros and Cons

Let's have a look what systemd actually makes better and what
are the problems that are new due to having systemd.

Again, this is not a rant-or-blame page, but focussed on
analysis and to make the basis for future steps.

If you do not agree with something written here, please

### Unifying Distributions

One interesting outcome of the development around systemd is that
many distributions adopt it. If you dislike systemd (for whatever reason)
this may be a disadvantage. However, having the same 
**init system** on all Unices would make life much easier
for sysadmins and authors of configuration management 
systems (like [cdist](http://www.nico.schottelius.org/software/cdist/).
