### Linux only orientation

The current implementation of systemd is highly Linux centric, 
which is a major problem if other software that is being used on other
Unices begins to depend on components of systemd.

At this point of point we know about
[gnome depending on systemd](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/10/msg00578.html) ([or not](http://blogs.gnome.org/ovitters/2013/09/25/gnome-and-logindsystemd-thoughts/), depending on your point of view).

Writing portable applications has the advantage of finding
bugs in your software and in contrary to what the systemd authors think,
POSIX is actually helping writing portable apps for a long time.
