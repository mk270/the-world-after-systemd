### Linux only orientation

The current implementation of systemd is highly Linux centric, 
which is a major problem if other software that is being used on other
Unices begins to depend on components of systemd.

At this point of point we know about
[gnome depending on systemd](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/10/msg00578.html), 
which makes gnome unavailable for any other
operating systems than Linux.

Furthermore, writing portable applications has the advantage of finding
bugs in your software.
