## What this site is about

Our aim is to find a good exit strategy for distros and users of systemd. 

We do so by analysing the current situation, 
the needs that systemd actual fulfills and the problems it causes
and how to get rid of those.

We focus on being productive for the next generation of people using
Linux and other Unices (yes, they exist and yes, they are important, too!).
