## What this site is about

We are beginning to write down our concerns about systemd,
what are the good and bad things it brings and how to move
on.

We focus on being productive for the next generation of people using
Linux and other Unices (yes, they exist and yes, they are important, too!).

## What is this site not about

It is not a place for ranting. 
If you want to blame/rant, please look for another site.
