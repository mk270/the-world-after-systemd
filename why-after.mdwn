## Why after systemd?

We think that even though many distros have adopted systemd,
the general design or motivation of the project is not good
and will lead to more problems than it solves.

We anticipate that systemd is currently in fashion, however many of
us have seen software rising and falling, especially if it was
ill designed (sendmail anyone?).

In that sense we are planning for the time when distros and users
are beginning to **migrate away from systemd**.
